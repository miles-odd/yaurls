# yaurls

<h3 align=center>
  yet another URL shortener
</h3>

<p align=center>
  ...because the world really needed another one of these.

## What is it?

**y**et **a**nother **URL s**hortener (**yaURLs**... get it?) is exactly what it says on the tin. Give it a long, (preferably) unwieldy URL, and it'll spit out a much shorter and cleaner-looking URL that you can share elsewhere to your heart's content. 

There may be additional features added in the future, but yeah, it's a URL shortener. It shortens URLs. That's the whole deal.

## What can it do?

Currently, yaurls supports such novel and unique features as:

- shortening a URL

Some additional features _are_ planned, such as:

- creating custom slugs (i.e. `yaurls.it/customslug`)
- creating click-limited/self-destructing links
- tracking statistics, such as number of (unique) clicks, location and device information, etc.

and possibly even more things, if I come up with more things and feel like adding them.

## Why am I making this?

As you may have figured out by now, this README hasn't been taking itself too seriously. And that's because this isn't supposed to be too serious of a project. It's not novel, impressively complex, or even better than other similar projects (`yaurls.it/blah` is actually pretty long for a "short" URL)... but that's okay, because I'm not trying to replace anything or invent something new!

This is actually my first time doing any sort of webdev-related project, so I needed something simple enough to actually finish that would maybe allow for a few additional features. A URL shortener just seemed like the right choice for that, with the added bonus that it could potentially be something that I end up using (not for any added benefit over other, existing URL shorteners, but just because it would be cool to use my own thing, y'know?).
